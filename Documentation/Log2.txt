Meeting Notes/Changes on plan and big design decisions
============================================================================================================================
Hena:
-->  Changes to display size of GUI page for courseDetailPage because font was small to see and was getting cut off.
-->  Instead of having the degreePanel and courseInfoScrollPane side by side, vertically splitting it into a pane in
     the center of the GUI.
-->  Having buttons for each courses to click to display information then a combo box (visually better)
-->  For iteration 3, change "View Courses" button to combo box with options "First Year", "Second Year", and "Upper Year"
     to show courses for that year.
-->  Instead of degreeOffered table having foreign key courseID, make degreeName a foreign key to table courseDetails
     because its more easier to retrieve the courses for that degree if the degree name is matched then to store a list 
     of courses for that degree in degreeOffered table.
     
Daoud:
--> DB Table / Schema Design decisions included using Primary Keys of "X" Tables as references (Foreign Keys) in another table.  
--> DB Hosting: Decided it would be worth hosting a single development server that we could all colloborate on. This would reduce headache 
    by setting up the DB once for everyone, rather than everyone dealing with the own instance/problems during setup and development. 
--> DB Persistance Interface Implementation: Develop for each feature/DB table a CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) Interface which 
    Business Logic will interact through.
